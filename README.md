# 🐍 Python Lab – Fundamental Concepts

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **`Python_lab.ipynb`** that demonstrates the foundational concepts of Python programming — from data types and operators to bitwise manipulation.  
It is intended for learning, practice, and quick revision of Python basics.

---

## 📘 Contents

The notebook includes the following topics:

### 🔹 Data Types
- Integer (`int`)  
- Floating point (`float`)  
- String (`str`)  
- Boolean (`bool`)

### 🔹 Comparison Operators
- Equal (`==`)  
- Not Equal (`!=`)  
- Greater Than (`>`)  
- Less Than (`<`)  
- Greater Than or Equal (`>=`)  
- Less Than or Equal (`<=`)

### 🔹 Bitwise Operations
- AND (`&`)  
- OR (`|`)  
- XOR (`^`)  
- One’s Complement (`~`)  
- Left Shift (`<<`)  
- Right Shift (`>>`)

Each section includes example code and outputs for better understanding.
